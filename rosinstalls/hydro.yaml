# If multiple branches (e.g. release/master, or release/devel), then use the non suffixed
# version to point to the one we usually download for sources development.
#
# e.g. rosjava/android core sources, we typically build on top of so we use the release sources.
# rocon sources on the other hand are our development, so always the devel sources.
